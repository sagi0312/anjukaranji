              Hi, I'm Anju.
              <br className="hidden lg:inline-block" />
              I build scalable web applications
              <br className="hidden md:inline-block" /> that solve real
              problems.

              I’m a Full-Stack Engineer who enjoys bringing calm and structure
              to complex systems — and turning ideas into shipped products.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              At Amazon, I built a Lambda-driven migration pipeline that
              processed 14M+ records in under 15 minutes and owned the frontend
              for a labor planning tool used across 140+ facilities. At
              Executive Homes, I worked on offline-first architecture to improve
              reliability in the field. Now at New York Life, I’m prototyping
              features that help insurance agents work more efficiently.

            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              I like building thoughtful software that balances clean
              architecture with real-world usability, especially where developer
              experience and product experience meet. I contribute to open
              source when I can and try to learn something from every project.
              Outside of work, you’ll usually find me watching sci-fi with my
              daughter or exploring mindfulness over a cup of chai.
