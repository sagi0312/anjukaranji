Eckhart Tolle says modern love relationships are a source of pain. Yet, despite all the heartbreaks and disappointments, we continue to chase this elusive feeling. You could get married and divorced five times and still believe the next one will finally make you gloriously happy. In spite of all the evidence to the contrary, we keep believing in the salvation that romantic relationships will provide.

I know that sounds cynical — it's not bitterness, just clarity… and maybe a touch of disappointment, lol. I grew up on a steady diet of Bollywood and 90s rom-coms. I felt certain — like, in my bones — that I will meet this charming man who will become my best friend and companion for life. For years, I believed that was part of my destiny. But now? I'm not so sure anymore.

Does this idea of "happily ever after" hold any real truth, or is it just a concept we all decided to adopt because it makes life bearable? Ancient Vedic traditions believed mother-child bond to be the highest form of love. Now, everyone and their mother believes they need romance in their lives.

If this concept became so universally celebrated, maybe there is a grain of truth buried somewhere in it — I honestly don't know. Still, I loved reading the chapter "Enlightened Relationships" in Eckhart Tolle's _The Power of Now_.

This might alleviate some of the pain experienced by hopeless romantics out there like me (I know I'm not alone — I know some of them personally).

And then there's Carrie Bradshaw — at the end of _And Just Like That_, she accepts that she might be on her own for the rest of her life… She dances alone in her apartment, wearing her tutu, completely at ease in her acceptance of this fact. That's been on my mind. It nudged me toward questioning and facing truths about my own life. Hence this blog lol.

Oh well. Sayonara, fellow hopeless romantics! 👋🏽
