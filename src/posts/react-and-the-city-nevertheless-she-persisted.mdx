**FIELD NOTE:** Continuing research on Project SayBuild, the voice-driven page builder.

After React Compiler restored my faith in chivalry, I decided to flirt with English literature — language parsing. The results were… how shall I put it? Humbling.

## 🔬 EXPERIMENT 2: Custom Pattern Matching for Voice Commands

**Objective:**

Teach the builder to understand speech without using an LLM.

**Why skip the obvious solution?**

Pride. Pure, unfounded pride.

**Hypothesis:**

If I can break every command into verbs, nouns, prepositions, and modifiers — then map them to CRUD operations on the component tree — I'll have unearthed "intelligence" once again.

**Estimated time to success:** 30 minutes. With beer breaks every 5.

### 🧠 Day 1 — Confidence Level: 100%

My parser is elegant. My pattern matching is flawless.

I'm basically building natural language understanding from scratch. Future historians will bow before the great Anju.

### 😵 Day 2 — Confidence Level: 12%

Turns out humans don't speak in clean patterns.

They mumble. They change their minds mid-sentence. They say things like, "Add a big-ish button in the middle of that... uh... brownish thingy."

Regex cried. I cried. We all cried.

### 🪦 DAY 3 – 3:00 AM

I surrender.

Deleted half the code. Summoned the LLM like a desperate summoning ritual, ego served on a platter.

It responded immediately.

It understood "Add a big-ish button in the middle of the brownish thingy."

It knew which component "it" referred to.

It handled every edge case I'd spent three days regex-fighting.

**Time to implement:** 45 minutes.

### ☠️ Conclusion:

Hubris detected.

Pattern matching is strong with the Dark Side.

LLM partnership initiated.

## 🧩 THE DIY PARSER PHASE (RIP)

The plan was simple:

- **Verbs** → CRUD operations (add, delete, update, move)
- **Nouns** → UI components (button, text, image)
- **Prepositions** → Spatial relationships (inside, below, next to)
- **Modifiers** → Props (big, blue, centered)

Linguistics 101, right? Just map words to actions.

Suffice to say, it was not Linguistics 101 😒

The way the LLM handled pattern matching, you'd think it was built on that very concept.

But then it hit me — why stop at parsing?

What if the LLM didn't just understand the commands… what if it orchestrated everything?

## 🧭 FIELD NOTE: The MCP Awakens

For the past year, everyone's been talking about MCP servers.

Every conference. Every LinkedIn post. Every "what's new in AI" panel.

I nodded along politely, secretly wondering, "Is this another blockchain in the making?" 🤨

Then I wandered into an MCP session at the Atlanta Developer Conference.

Dimly lit room. Engineers leaning forward.

The presenter described it simply: lightweight servers that let LLMs talk with structure, schema, and boundaries — clean delegation, clear contracts.

Something clicked.

I walked out of that room knowing exactly what I had to do.

So I did what any reasonable developer would: went home, abandoned my laundry to its fate, and rewired SayBuild overnight.

## 🧩 Curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction brought it back

**The Setup:**

**2 MCP Servers:**

- 🧠 **State Server** — reads and writes to the component tree
- 📊 **Data Server** — holds component-tree.json + Chokidar watcher

**Other players:**

- 1 **LLM**: the orchestrator — smart enough to delegate
- 1 **Next.js App**: the display layer with live updates via SSE

Converted the project to a pnpm workspace with proper package separation. Immediately pushed 123MB of node_modules to GitHub because /node_modules only ignores root — not workspace folders.

**Public Service Announcement for monorepo newbies:** use `node_modules` (without '/') in order to ignore it everywhere. 🙇🏽♀️

## 🧭 MCP Architecture

Next up: wiring it all together — two MCP servers, one LLM orchestrator, and a stubborn developer who just wouldn't quit. Stay tuned for Part 3: The Servers Strike Back.
