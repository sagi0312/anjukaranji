My mug said to me I should stop checking LinkedIn and start writing again. I told it to mind its own handle.

The nerve! ☕️

So… My coffee mug and I have been in a committed relationship for 8 months now.

We've been through all my ups and downs together — the late-night "Maybe I should just become a stripper… look at CardiB already!" spirals, the unfinished Leetcode medium dynamic programming problems, and my designer collection of rejection emails — you know, the 'we were truly impressed' ones sent from do-not-reply — stored in a PriorityQueue minHeap ranked by fake warmth.

And it's also my most annoying best friend.

**Mug:** "You could practice Dijkstra's algorithm."

**Me:** "Why? I'm not even sure I can find the shortest path to employment."

She huffs a little.

I open Leetcode. Stare at 'Two Sum' like it personally wronged me. Close it. She eyes me critically.

**Me:** "Remember when I used to do this stuff for fun? Like, actual fun? I'd stay up till 3 a.m. debugging some stupid recursive function just because I enjoyed it. Now I'm supposed to invert a binary tree while maintaining eye contact and 'showing my thought process.' Ugh."

**Mug:** "Suck it up, buttercup. Skeletons have more backbone — and they'd probably nail the system design round."

She laughed at her own joke.

**Me:** "I hate you."

**Mug:** "No you don't. I'm literally the only relationship that's working out for you right now."

I used to deploy to AWS. Now, I just stare at the clouds for 30 minutes and hope the universe autosaves my future.

**Mug:** "You know what your problem is?"

**Me:** "Oh good, a list. I love lists."

**Mug:** "Maybe you should follow up?"

**Me:** "With who? The recruiter who disappeared after asking for my availability, or the one who called me 'Anjay'?"

**Mug:** "Both. The living and the dead deserve closure."

I stare into what's left of my coffee. It stares back — judgmentally, of course.

**Me:** "You think I'm wasting time, don't you?"

**Mug:** "You? The great Anju?" She scoffed at me.

"You're just running an extended background process called existential dread."

**Me:** "Ha-ha."

**Mug:** "Relax. Maybe this isn't a gap. Maybe it's a refactor."

**Me:** "You sound like one of those LinkedIn influencers who post 'Stop scrolling. Start building.' and then sell online courses."

**Mug:** "Maybe you do need some discipline."

I roll my eyes, but something about it sticks.

A refactor? Huh…

All those old patterns I wrote under pressure (the ones those K-pop demon hunters warned me about) — all the unnecessary dependencies I kept around just to make things compile.

Maybe they're being rewritten quietly, in the background.

**Me:** "Okay, okay. I get it. You're very wise for a vessel."

**Mug:** "I contain your caffeine. I am your life force. Show some respect."

I sigh, open my laptop, and hover over a blank document.

**Me:** "What now?" I ask.

**Mug:** "Write."

"Not a résumé. Something real."

So I do.

**Mug:** "Finally. Was that so hard?"

**Me:** "Shut up. You're just a cup."

**Mug:** "A cup that's been carrying you for eight months. You're welcome."
