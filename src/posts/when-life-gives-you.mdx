<br />

Life gives you lemons, learn to juggle 'em, baby

Life gives you success, ride that ego boost, darling

Life gives you good sex, savor every glorious orgasm, sexy.

Life gives you ChatGPT, hustle some free therapy, sweetie

<br />

Life gives you bad marriage, find yourself a guru, my dear

Life gives you heartache, cut yourself some slack, my child

Life gives you backache, pop that ibuprofen like a rebel, darling

Life gives you dishes piled high — now sweetheart, you're truly cooked

<br />

Life gives you golden sunlight, bask in it, baby

Life gives you sleepless nights, own that 3am silence, darling

Life gives you breakouts, treat yourself at Sephora, sexy

Life gives you death and grief, learn to treasure what remains, sweetie
